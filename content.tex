  \item GANTT chart for planning / time-line
\end{itemize}


Have processes of
\begin{itemize}
  \item Specify
  \item Design
  \item Build
  \item Test
  \item Modify
  \item Evaluate
\end{itemize}

\section{Project : Selection Critical}\textbf{2016/09/27}\\
Should:\\
Provide something\\
Have design choices\\
Be achievable (could)\\
Possibly as I do in my workplace\\
Could use a project in work for project\\
 Where naturally accessible at work\\

\section{Project : Selection Criteria}\textbf{2016/10/04}\\
Could:\\
A physical product\\
A system product, a remote monitoring system\\
A service product, a engineering service\\
\\
Replication or extension of an existing product to enhance the service\\

\section{Project Selection}\textbf{2016/10/08}\\
I did some discovery work for a few of the project in my initial project ideas\\
IR Remote - nearly achieved before customer needs changed\\
Lidar has commercial modules available - down to timing accuracy\\
USB Type C PD specification is hundreds of pages long - too difficult\\

\section{Project Final Idea}\textbf{2016/10/11}\\
RF Immunity test system\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Control test equipment
  \item Monitor and control via feedback path
  \item Produce test report data
  \item Use Calibration factors
  \item Apply test standard \gls{EN61000-4-6:2014}
\end{itemize}
Customers will be test engineers at work\\


\section{Needs analysis}\textbf{2016/10/18}\\
To access is there a commercial or technical market\\
A survey may be used to derive a set of design specifications\\
Product performs in a repeatable manner\\
Product uses proven technology\\
Low incremental running cost : per runtime\\
Simple to maintain\\
Adaptable to new tests\\
Must stop/abort a test in a safe manner\\
Must apply correction factors\\

Project Specification from customer:\\
Time scale\\
Constraint dates\\
Availability of test set up for development\\
Plan installation\\
Set up drawing / work instructions\\

\section{Select solution}\textbf{2016/10/25}\\
Select from three solutions
This business sector has a couple of ready made platform products\\
LabVIEW by NI\\
VEE Pro by Keysight\\
Python 3 by Python Foundation\\
  With addition of some modules to communicate with test equipment\\

I am familiar with Python\\
I am using Python with instruments  already\\
This project should be viable for the use case\\
My employer already owns relevant hardware\\
I have access to expertise and relevant experience\\

\section{Test process : Calculations for running test}\textbf{2016/11/01}\\
Calibrations are performed a higher amplitude than the test level\\
We need to calculate the level that we need to apply\\
Calibration\\

\input{table_calibrationdata}
.\\
For a calibration performed at 18V\\
For a test run to be performed at 10V\\
Offset V = Calibration power V : Wanted power V\\
Offset dBm = V2dBm(offset dBm)\\
Target forward power = forward power dBm : Offset dBm\\

Levelling performed without and with any AM applied\\
Dwell for time in both CW and AM modulation?\\

\section{Estimated time}\textbf{2016/11/08}\\\lstinputlisting[language=Python, caption=Estimated Time]{py_estimatedtime.py}

\section{Unit conversion}\textbf{2016/11/08}\\
Power meters operate in units of Watts or dBm\\
Our target level for calibration is in Volts\\
Our meter has best linearity in Watts\\
Therefore conversion between Watts and Volts is required\\
\lstinputlisting[language=Python, caption=Power meter calculations]{py_powermetercalcs.py}

\section{Project Specification Revised}\textbf{2016/11/15}\\

Functional requirements when running a test\\
Instrument control\\
  Power meter\\
  Signal generator\\
Step frequency steps\\
Use/apply calibration factors\\
Calculate the expected power with given CDN factors at coupling point\\
Level with given tolerance to calculated power\\
Dwell time must be at-least minimum time\\
Display a plot during test\\
Have a mode of operation for validating an EUT fault\\
  mini sweep over last n points\\
Pause standby a test\\
Stop a test\\
