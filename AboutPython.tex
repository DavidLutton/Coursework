\subsection{Python}
\label{sec:Python}
\gls{Python} is a programming language available from \href{https://python.org}{Python.org}\\

Windows XP support terminated with Python 3.4.4\\
Otherwise always use the highest numbered version\\

When installing Python offers to include the runtime in PATH always set this option on\\
Otherwise you need to invoke the Python runtime with the full path every time\\

\gls{venv} is a module that is part of the Python core that creates Python virtual environments\\
This venv can be used to install modules separately from the system installation\\
If used correctly this allows programs to be reliably installed and this provides reasonable assurance that the program will operate the same way on a different computer\\

Extra Python functionality is built up of modules available from \gls{Pypi} or \gls{Git}\\
These modules are installable via \gls{pip}\\

For example:\\
\`pip install pyserial\`\\
Installs the module to utilise serial ports and includes a small serial terminal application.\\

Python is a programming language that uses spaces to delineate nested flow control\\

I have written a number of .bat scripts to install, start, run, (Utilities, Serial console, GPIB console, Code checkers)\\
