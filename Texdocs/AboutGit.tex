\subsection{Git}
\label{sec:Git}
Git is a fast version control system\\
Nearly all operations occur locally\\
Distributed, clones (replicas) are by default full copys of the project history\\
Users commit into a repository, repositoryâ€™s have checksums for each file in a commit and respective metadata\\
Ergo modifying history will invalidate checksums in a provable way\\

Diffs for text based files or files that can be presented in a textual manner, can have diffs that represent the changes from the current master to the files in the working area\\
